Load Balancer concept:
-------------------------

Application Load Balancer (ALB)
ğŸ”„ Routing: Based on URL paths, hostnames, headers.
ğŸ”§ Protocols/Ports: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443).
ğŸ’» Use Case: Web apps, microservices.
ğŸŒŸ Example: Routes https://example.com/api to one server and https://example.com/images to another.
ğŸš€ Advantage: Advanced content-based routing.

ğŸ”¹ Network Load Balancer (NLB)
ğŸ”„ Routing: TCP/UDP traffic.
ğŸ”§ Protocols/Ports: TCP/UDP (any port).
ğŸ’» Use Case: Real-time apps, gaming.
ğŸŒŸ Example: Routes TCP traffic on port 80 to multiple servers.
ğŸš€ Advantage: High performance and low latency.

ğŸ”¹ Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
ğŸ”„ Routing: Round Robin, Least Requests.
ğŸ”§ Protocols/Ports: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), TCP (any port).
ğŸ’» Use Case: Basic web apps.
ğŸŒŸ Example: Distributes HTTP requests evenly or to the least busy server.
ğŸš€ Advantage: Simple load balancing for legacy applications.


ğŸ”¹ Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
ğŸ”„ Routing: Traffic to security appliances.
ğŸ”§ Protocols/Ports: TCP/UDP (any port).
ğŸ’» Use Case: Network security.
ğŸŒŸ Example: Sends traffic to firewalls or intrusion detection systems.
ğŸš€ Advantage: Simplifies integration of network security appliances.
